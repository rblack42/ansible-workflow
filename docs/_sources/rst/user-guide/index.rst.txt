Part 4 - R2T3 User Guide

..  include::   /header.inc

The R2T3 machine is intended to support a variety of purposes. Obviously, it is
intended for testing motors, either short test motors, or actual flight-ready
motors. The torque, tension component together with the visual display can be
separated from the machine and used at a flying site. If you really want to go
crazy, you could take the entire system, even though it might be too long for
your vehicle, to the site and let it wind your motora before each flight. 

In this section, we will go over each component of the machine and explain how
it is used. Example data from actual tests will be shown as we examine the
various components. 

All components are physically mounted on a single wooden plank to keep things
organized and simple to set up for use. The major components are these:

- linear slide and winding motor
- Torque/Tension meter
- Control computer system
- visual display

It is possible to use a laptop with a wireless connection to control the
machine if desired.
