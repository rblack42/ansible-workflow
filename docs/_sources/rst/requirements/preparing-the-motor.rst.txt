Tools of the Trade
==================

"Coach Chuck", and NFFS Science Olympiad coach posted a video on building an indoor motor that is very helpful (see `this link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u4ghL21ij8&t=634s>`_.

1. Rubber - FAI Supply (1/16, 3/32, 1/8
2. O-ring cut 1mm thick from nylon antenna tubing (Dubro 511)
3. Short folded piece of 0.018 wire to pull rubber through O-ring
4. Good scissors 
5. Indoor scale (American Scale Gemini-20) or equivalent
	- Hot glue 1/8 brass tube to weigh pan
	- use 1/8 carbon tube with slit foam square on top for weighing
6. Rubber lube: Team Associated 5426 27.5 Weight Silicone Shock Fluid
7. Metal Ruler for measuring motor
8. Record slip to record data
9. Snack zip bag to store finished rubber.

Preparing motor
===============

1. Wash rubber in warm water with dish soap to remove powder from box
2. cut to weight:
	hang rubber on scale with extra horizontal. Cut along horizontal straight to get desired weight.
3. put rubber into folder wire. 
4. slide O-rings onto motor using ne up two wnds
5. Clamp end close to end in hemostats
6. Lube motor 
7. Create simple knot with entire loop, getting knot close to hemostat. Pull two strands to pull the knot closer to the hemostat. 
8. Create a second know the same way
9. Release hemostat and apply drop of CA to end strips againat the knot.
10. Measure length of finished motor.
11. Weight final motor weight
12. Record data on info sheet
