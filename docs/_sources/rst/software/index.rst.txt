Part 3 - Software Development
#############################

..  include::   /header.inc

The **R2T3** device has a number of parts that need support from a computer to
manage their operation:

- Linear slide gantry (stepper motor)
- Winding motor control (DC speed control)
- Wind Counter (DC motor counter interface)
- Torque/Tension measurements (Load cell interface)
- User interface (Touch screen interface)

All of these functions can be provided by a variety of |PY|_ libraries. Our job
will be to interface these support tools to create a useable tool for the model
builder.
