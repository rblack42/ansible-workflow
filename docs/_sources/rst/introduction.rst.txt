What is **R2T3**? Well, how about *Roie's Rubber Torque and Tension Tester*? This
article details how I built a computer controlled test fixture that is being
used to gather data on the performance of rubber motors used for indoor model
airplanes. My intent is to use the data being gathered to build a mathematical
model for rubber that can be used to help predict how a design will fly. This
article is part of my |MM|_ project where I to document my research work in
indoor model aviation.  

This is my third article in that effort. The first article used |OSC|_ and
|PY|_ to demonstrate how you can design a indoor airplane using some
fascinating tools :cite:`black2021`. The second article used a number of
advanced |PY|_ tools to demonstrate how you can analyze a design and attempt
to predict flight times for that model :cite:`black2022`. If you read that last
article, you might recall that the rubber (and propeller) models used were a
bit weak. My efforts now are intended to fix those problems. To do that I need to be able to test rubber motors to see how they perform. Hopefully, the data I collect will help be build a theoretical model of an indoor motor suitable for use inc analyzingindoor models.

Background
==========

At the ripe old age of eight, I started on a quest to figure out how a certain
model airplane managed to fly. The airplane was a rubber powered `Henderson
Gadfly <https://outerzone.co.uk/plan_details.asp?ID=2475>`_ from the April, 1955 edition of *Model Airplane News*. This model
was built by a neighbor on my newspaper route, and I saw him fly it
one evening while I was delivering papers. I was fascinated by what I saw and
how amazing that flight was. I had to know how all of that happened!

My quest took me into a career as an aerospace Engineer in the USAF, and into
a second career as a Professor of Computer Science at Austin Community College
in Austin, Texas. Along the way, I discovered a passion for doing research and
digging into the mathematics of flight, then using computers of all kinds to try
to solve the mathematical equations that can tell us how a flight vehicle will
fly, even before we build anything real!

When I finally retired, I decided to continue my research work, but this time
apply it to something I started doing while in high school -- designing,
building, and flying indoor model airplanes. 


Scientific Research
-------------------

Generally, scientific research falls into one of two major categories.  The
first major category, *Experimental Research*, studies the behavior of some
system as it performs in its natural environment. In aeronautics, that means we
test an actual airplane in flight, or study a model of that vehicle in
something like a wind tunnel.  *Theoretical Research*, the second major category,
seeks to generate a mathematical model of the system we are studying. As it
turns out, we need both kinds of research to move forward.  A theory must be
shown to actually predict how a real system will perform. We *validate* the
theory using data from experimental research. If our theory produces results
that closely match the experimental data, we gain trust in the theory. Without
that trust, using the theory to predict anything is risky!

Project Goal
============

As mentioned above, I want to build a mathematical model of an indoor rubber
motor. In researching other work in this area, I have found a number of studies
that have resulted in some simple tools for predicting the number of turns a
motor can sustain before breaking :cite:`slusarczyk2014`, and how much tension a
motor generates :cite:`slusarczyk2017`, :cite:`pearce1979a` and :cite:`pearce1979b`. I have also found some data on the torque vs turns for some motors :cite:`tenny1968`.
My hope is to base my model on current research into the physics of rubber, and
I have found quite a number of references into that area.

In order to validate my mathematical model, I need experimental data. Most
indoor flyers measure the simple things: rubber size and loop length, weight,
number of turns used for each flight, and, if they have the equipment, the
torque provided to the propeller at launch for each flight. They most also
record the flight times and, perhaps, the number of turns remaining when the
flight ends. All good data, but not detailed enough to work on a better
mathematical model of the rubber motor.

My hope is that the **R2T3** device described in this article will help me
gather much more detailed data on what happens when we wind up a motor for a
flight. At present, I have a prototype test device, but I am working to build a
second version that is both cheaper to construct, and better suited for testing
actual flight-worthy motors.

The Project Flow
================

The rest of this article will proceed in four parts:

Part 1 - Requirements
---------------------

Here we will cover the requirements for the test device. This involves looking
at how we use a rubber motor in the course of a flight. The goal here is to
detail the data items we intend to collect.

Part 2 - Hardware
-----------------

Once we know what data we want to collect, we need to put together the hardware
that can provide the individual data items. In some cases, the parts we need
are readily available. In others, we need to build the needed parts. I will use
|OSC|_ to detail those parts.

Part 3 - Software
-----------------

The basic requirement in this project is to use computers to control the
testing process. I will be using |PY|_ to create all project code. The
development of that code will be shown here.

Part 4 - Sample Output
----------------------

In this final section, I will present example output from the test device. This
section is presented in the form of a user's manual for the **R2T3** machine.
