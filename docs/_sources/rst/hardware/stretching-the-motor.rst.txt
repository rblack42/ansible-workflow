Stretching the Motor
####################

..  include::   /header.inc

The first step in winding a motor is to stretch it out some distance. Exactly
how far to stretch is something of an art. The builder gets a "feel" for how
much tension they are willing to exert on the motor before they start winding.
Some modelers pull the motor out and hold it for a period of time before
beginning to wind. 

As the wind progresses, the modeler moves inward toward the propeller end of the
motor. Winding strips when a turn count, or torque value is reached. At that
point, the motor is transferred to the model for flight.

Obviously, we will need a device that can perform these steps in our test
machine. The obvious solution is to use a linear slide device to accomplish the
stretching and relaxing of that stretch as the wind progresses.

Fortunately, there are many parts available these days that will do exactly what
we want, largely due to the explosion in computer controlled printers and
milling machines of various types.

I found a simple kit at `Openbuilds
<https://builds.openbuilds.com/builds/v-slot%e2%84%a2-nema-23-linear-actuator-belt-driven.7821/>`_ that
I used to build a basic 1500mm linear slide to serve as the first test bed for
my automated tester idea.

Building the Linear Slide
=========================

The kit I ordered is fairly simple to assemble, however what arrived at my home
included no indication of what to do with all the parts. Fortunately, there is
a video link on their website detailing the assembly of the basic slide
`Openbuild Assembly Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHn-gffborc>`_.

For reference, here is the parts list for this linear slider:

When I originally ordered this kit, the longest rail listed was 1500mm, slightly
under five feet. The actual sliding platform can only cover about six inches
less than this due to the mounding hardware for the motor and belt. I discovered
that a 200mm linear rail and suitable timing belt is available, but I elected to
use this setup for my initial testing. 

We now have the ability to stretch a test motor, but we have more work to do.
We need to wind the motor!
