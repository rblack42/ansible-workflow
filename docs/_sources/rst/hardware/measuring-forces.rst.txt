Measuring Forces
################

..  include::   /header.inc

There are two kinds of forces used in preparing a rubber motor for flight:
*torque* which is a rotational force, and *tension* which is a linear force.
Since torque is what spins the propeller, most modelers focus on this one.
However, tension is important as well. The tension in the motor tends to bend
the motor stick leading to sometimes unexpected trim problems. 

Torque Meters
=============

Many indoor flyers use a Torque Meter* to gauge the power that the rubber will
provide to the propeller. Probably the most common kind of *torque meter* uses
a length of steel wire attached to a pointer that indicates the torque as the
wire twists as the motor is wound.

Here is an example, available from `LaserCutPlanes <https://www.lasercutplanes.com/product/dirt-cheap-torque-meter/>`_.

Tension Meters
==============

Measuring tension used to be a common thing. In the old days, scales were often
hanging up in grocery stores and you weighed something by placing it in a tray.
The weight of the thing in the tray was indicated by a dial which actually
measured the tension on the hokk holding the scale up/ Today, a modern tension
guage is most likely digital and looks like this:

This device is available from *American Weigh Scales* through Amazon and was
used by Don Slusarczyk in an article he wrote, *Testing Rubber for Strength" in
the July 2017 issue of *Model Aviation* :cite:`slusarczyk2017`.
