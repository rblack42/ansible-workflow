This is hardware project that documents the design and construction of a
computerized rubber motor tester for indoor model airplanes. The project is
part of the *Math Majik* project I started in 2021 to manage a number of
subprojects aimed at designing and building indoor model airplanes. 

The test device presented here is designed to produce data that will be used in
a subsequent theoretical development dealing with the physics of rubber strip
motors which are subjected to both stretching and winding to provide power for
the model airplanes we fly.
